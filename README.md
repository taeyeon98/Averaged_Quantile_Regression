R scripts and data for “Forecasting High‑Dimensional Non‑Normal Time Series Using Averaged Quantile Regression.”

Start with Numerical experiments (Monte Carlo).R to reproduce the simulation study, then run Empirical application to US economic data.R for the CPI forecasting exercise.
The nowcasting package required by both scripts is no longer on CRAN; please install it from the CRAN‑archive or GitHub mirror before execution.
All monthly indicators used in the empirical section are provided in US_economic_data.csv.
